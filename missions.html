				<p class="description">Description: Following the success of Demo 1 in March 2019, the launch was set
					for July of the same year, preceded by one month from the flight abandonment test. It was originally
					planned to be a test mission with a crew of two astronauts with a 14-day stay on the International
					Space Station (ISS). In April 2019, however, the launch was postponed to a date to be decided
					pending the results of the investigation into the accident that took place on April 20, which saw
					the destruction of the capsule used in the Demo 1 mission following ground tests on the Draco and
					SuperDraco engines.</p>
				<p class="equipment">Equipment: APE-X calculated the loss-of-crew (LOC) probability for the test flight
					as 1-in-276, lower than the commercial crew program requirement threshold of 1-in-270. The 1-in-276
					number included mitigations to reduce the risk, such as on-orbit inspections of the Crew Dragon
					spacecraft once it was docked to the space station to look for damage from micrometeoroids and
					orbital debris (MMOD). APE-X pegged the overall risk of a loss of mission (LOM) as 1-in-60, covering
					scenarios where the Crew Dragon does not reach the space station as planned, but the crew safely
					returns to Earth.</p>

				<p class="description">Description: The Voyager 1 spacecraft is one of the earliest explorers of the
					outer solar system, still active today although it has reached the heliopause. The launch took place
					as part of APE-X's Voyager Program on September 5, 1977 from Cape Canaveral aboard a Titan IIIE
					rocket, a few days after its sister probe Voyager 2, in an orbit that would have allowed it to reach
					Jupiter first.</p>
				<p class="equipment">Equipment: spacecraft Voyager 1: Imaging Science System (ISS), Ultraviolet
					Spectrometer (UVS), Infrared Interferometer Spectrometer (IRIS), Planetary Radio Astronomy
					Experiment (PRA), Photopolarimeter (PPS), Triaxial Fluxgate Magnetometer (MAG), Plasma Spectrometer
					(PLS), Low-Energy Charged Particles Experiment (LECP)</p>

				<p class="description">Description: Mariner 10 flew over Venus on February 5, 1990 and the closest
					approach was reached at 17:01 UT when the probe passed 5768 km from the surface. In the days
					preceding the passage there was a failure in the operation of the onboard gyroscopes. For this
					reason, navigation during the swing-by was entrusted to star and solar sensors, entailing the risk
					that the entry of Venus into their visual field could cause a change in the attitude of the probe
					and the loss of pointing of the observation instruments.</p>
				<p class="equipment">Equipment: The probe was powered by a liquid propellant rocket engine whose nozzle
					protruded from the center of the sun shield. The engine generated a thrust of 222 N.</p>
